When our brains constantly scan for and focus on the positive, we profit from three of the most important tools available to us: happiness, gratitude, and optimism.

brings. The second mechanism at work here is gratitude, because the more opportunities for positivity we see, the more grateful we become .

The third driver of the Positive Tetris Effect is optimism. This instinctively makes sense; the more your brain picks up on the positive, the more you’ll expect this trend to continue, and so the more optimistic you’ll be. And optimism, it turns out, is a tremendously powerful predictor of work performance. Studies have shown that optimists set more goals (and more difficult goals) than pessimists, and put more effort into attaining those goals, stay more engaged in the face of difficulty , and rise above obstacles more easily. 12 Optimists also cope better in high stress situations and are better able to maintain high levels of well-being during times of hardship— all skills that are crucial to high performance in a demanding work environment.

As you might have guessed , it turns out that there is no such thing—in a scientific sense, at least— as luck. The only difference (and it is a big one) is whether or not people think that they are lucky— in essence, whether they expect good or bad things to happen to them.

The best way to kick-start this is to start making a daily list of the good things in your job, your career, and your life. It may sound hokey, or ridiculously simple— and indeed the activity itself is simple— but over a decade of empirical studies has proven the profound effect it has on the way our brains are wired. When you write down a list of “three good things” that happened that day, your brain will be forced to scan the last 24 hours for potential positives— things that brought small or large laughs, feelings of accomplishment at work, a strengthened connection with

family, a glimmer of hope for the future. In just five minutes a day, this trains the brain to become more skilled at noticing and focusing on possibilities for personal and professional growth, and seizing opportunities to act on them.
