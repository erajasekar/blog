**What is difference between Knowledge, Intelligence and Creativity?**

*Knowledge* is facts, information, and skills acquired by a person through experience or education by perceiving, discovering or learning. 

*Intelligence* is using that knowledge in different contexts to invent new thoughts, ideas, etc. 

*Creativity* is using intelligence to create new work, inventions etc.

**Why mere knowledge is not enough?**

if we just keep accumulating knowledge without applying it, it can easily get lost. We need to retain the knowledge to be able to apply and gain the intelligence out of it. Let's think about how knowledge is stored in memory to find out how to make it easily accessible.

**How knowledge is stored in memory?**

The things we learn generally get stored in short-term working memory. Anyting we retain in memory create new connections or change existing connections in the brain. But brain has only limited space in short-term memory. Most things get discarded out of short-term memory. We mostly use repetition to make items in short-term memory stay long enough. But the biggest problem with memorization through repetition is that it frequetly puts the information on just one connection. The brain always seeks meaning, patterns with exiting information to make more connections. The more ways you have to find a piece of information, the easier it is to retrieve.

To make anything you learn reach long-term memory, associate it with a meaning, associtate it with different context, associate it with simliar things - *don't learn anything in isolation*. 






Our education system is mostly designed around providing and evaluating the knowledge acquired. Also with experience we usually accumulate knowledge. But just acquiring knowledge doesn't give you intelligence. Lets understand little about how our brain works to understand why knowledge provide intelligence.

Lets understand how knowledge gets stored. anything you retain will create new connections or change existing connections in the brain

Short-term Working memory, Long-Term Permanent Memory
Repition will make make items in working memory stay long enough. The biggest problem with memorization through repetition is that it frequently puts the information on just one shelf.

when you learn something by usuing it in context, you put it on multiple shelves and learn how to use that information in multiple contexts.

brain has limited space for short-term memory. The brain is always seeking meaning, if information is not meaningful or allowed to form patterns in brain, it will be lost.

Anything that you do remember becomes series of associations- you don't learn anything in isoloation.

The more ways you have to find a piece of information, the easier it is to retrieve.
