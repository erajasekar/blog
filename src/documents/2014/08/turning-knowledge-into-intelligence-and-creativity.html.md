**What is difference between Knowledge, Intelligence and Creativity?**

*Knowledge* is facts, information, and skills acquired by a person through experience or education by perceiving, discovering or learning. 

*Intelligence* is using that knowledge in different contexts to invent new thoughts, new ideas, etc. 

*Creativity* is using intelligence to create new work, new inventions etc.

**Why mere knowledge is not enough?**

if we just keep accumulating knowledge without applying it, it can easily get lost. We need to make knowledge easily accessible to be able gain the intelligence out of it. Let's think about how knowledge is stored in memory to find out how we can retain it.

**How knowledge is stored in memory?**

The brain contains dynamic connection of neurons. Anyting we retain in memory create new connections or change existing connections in the brain. The things we learn generally get stored in short-term working memory. But brain has only limited space in short-term memory. Most things get discarded out of short-term memory. 

We mostly use repetition technique to make items in short-term memory stay long enough. But the biggest problem with memorization through repetition is that it frequetly puts the information on just one connection. The brain always seeks meaning, patterns with exiting information to make more connections. The more ways you have to find a piece of information, the easier it is to retrieve.

**How to improve your intelligence?**

Whenever you learn, associate it with a meaning, associtate it with a context, associate it with simliar things - *don't learn anything in isolation*. This will make it retain in long-term memory. Then knowledge will be easily retrievable when you want to apply it in a different context. This can help with generating new ideas.

**How to improve your creativity?**

> Creativity is “just connecting things.” - **Steve Jobs**

Creativity is using imagination to connect, stretch and merge things in new ways. To improve creativity we need to further expand connections of information in our brain so that it can be easily combined, transformed to create new ideas. *Curiosity* can help expanding connections and is the essential element for becoming more creative. 

> Curiosity is a lens through which you view everything around you. Without it,there are no adventures to be had, With it, there are enough for a million times - **Sean Patrick , Awakening your inner genius ** 

Curiosity will presuade you to seek interesting things, discover new information, explore related things. 

**Summary**

We acquire knowledge through learning and experiences. When you learn, try to associate it with as many things you can. Always learn with curiosity which can help to expand knowledge, making connections for that information stronger.

**Education System**

Unfortunately, our education system is mostly designed around providing and evaluating the knowledge acquired. Also with experience we usually accumulate knowledge.


Curiosity is a lens through which you view everything around you. Without it,there are no adventures to be had, With it, there are enough for a million times. 

curiosity. It’s an essential part of becoming more creative. Expand your interests in life.

Steve Jobs said creativity is “just connecting things.”
When you start viewing creativity as a process of combination, and imagination as the ability to connect, stretch, and merge things in new ways,

Lets understand how knowledge gets stored. anything you retain will create new connections or change existing connections in the brain

Short-term Working memory, Long-Term Permanent Memory
Repition will make make items in working memory stay long enough. The biggest problem with memorization through repetition is that it frequently puts the information on just one shelf.

when you learn something by usuing it in context, you put it on multiple shelves and learn how to use that information in multiple contexts.

brain has limited space for short-term memory. The brain is always seeking meaning, if information is not meaningful or allowed to form patterns in brain, it will be lost.

Anything that you do remember becomes series of associations- you don't learn anything in isoloation.

The more ways you have to find a piece of information, the easier it is to retrieve.
