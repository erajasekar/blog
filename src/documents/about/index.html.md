I'm Rajasekar Elango, software engineer. I work in Java, Spring and other JVM languages. I am passionate about technology, programming, books and astrology.
I like listening to music, coding for my personal projects during free time. 

I share my thoughts, things I learn, things that interests me in this blog.
